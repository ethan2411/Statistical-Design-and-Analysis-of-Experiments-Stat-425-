Project #1 is analyzing an experiment done to see if increasing concentrations of lime sulpher solution acts as a strong bee repellent. This design had 8 groups
  of 100 bees that were released into 8 different chambers.

Project #2 is analyzing an experiment to see if we can taste an apple's bitterness. This experiment was a Balanced Incomplete Block Design with 20 tasters
  and 4 different types of apples.
